# Customer-Churn-Insight-Telecom
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Telecom Customer Churn dataset**. The goal is to understand customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and generate business insights.

---

## 📊 Key Objectives:

- Understand data structure and feature distribution.
- Handle missing values and clean the dataset.
- Perform univariate and multivariate analysis.
- Explore correlation between customer churn and features.
- Apply feature engineering techniques.
- Visualize churn trends using graphs and plots.

---

## 📁 Dataset:

The dataset used is `telecom_customer_churn.csv` which contains various details like:
- Customer demographics
- Gender Distribution 
- Payment methods
- Monthly charges
- Churn status

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Vs code

---

## 📌 Highlights:

- Cleaned and processed raw telecom data
- Handled missing values efficiently
- Created dummy variables for categorical data
- Visualized churn trends by contract type, tenure, charges, etc.
- Feature engineering for better modeling (if extended to ML)
